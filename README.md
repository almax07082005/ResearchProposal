# Research Proposal

This project is for writing research proposal during EAP 4-th module.

I added .gitignore file, which ignores all files except source ones, such as ```main.tex```, ```ref.bib```, and so on. Thus, if you want to add new file, which should be in remote repository, please add it to .gitignore. I did so to prevent problems with compilation. Also, to check for correctness of updated files.

### Hence, to work with this project you should do the following:

1) Execute the following command to clone the repo: ```git clone https://github.com/almax07082005/ResearchProposal.git```.
2) Two ways:
    - either compile ```main.tex``` file with your texlive compiler (which you may or may not install),
    - or move these files to any other external compiler (e.g. Overleaf), work there, then copy changed files to the local repo.
3) Make a pull request to commit changes.
4) Wait until approvance.
