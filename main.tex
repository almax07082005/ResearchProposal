\section{Introduction/Background and Rationale (choose any)}
Please, state the problem and explain its significance. Clearly indicate your research goal, research question(s), or hypothesis/-es. Refer to the existing literature as need be. 

Your Introduction can also add definitions of terms if you think you use any that can be confusing to the reader (optional). You can also add the limits you assign to your research (optional) here. You can use subsections to make your writing clearer. Any number of subsections can be used or no subsections at all.
\subsection{Title of subsection 1}

This is how you cite a figure in your text: \textit{Fig. \ref{fig:inno} shows a logo of Innopolis University.}

\begin{figure}[htp]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=6cm]{figs/inno.png}
    \caption{Image of IU logo.}
    \label{fig:inno}
\end{figure}Example of referencing equations: 



\begin{equation}\label{my_first_eqn}
e=mc^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}\label{my_second_eqn}
e=fc^2
\end{equation}

This is now you cite equations in your text: \textit{Equation (\ref{my_first_eqn}) shows a well-known relation}.
\subsection{Title of subsection 2}
Use subsections to make your writing clearer.
\section{Literature Review}

Integration of DevOps have some difficulties. DevOps can be integrated with control approach [1]. Some difficulties can be resolved with the use of framework for mitigating risk [2]. Moreover, when adopting DevOps, framework for automatic detection can be used [3]. DevOps flexibility can improve security [4]. This systematic literature review monitors tools for DevOps [5].

\section{Methods/Methodology/Procedure/Research Design (choose any)}
Provide reasoning behind the proposed methods/methodology/procedure. Refer to the literature about the use of methods in similar studies. 

Discuss a research approach that you are adopting (inductive or deductive). Assess time, resources, and skills required to complete your research. Describe how you are going to collect data and prepare them. List the limitations of the suggested methodology and provide ways to overcome them.


Any number of subsections can be used or no subsections at all.
\subsection{Name of subsection 1}
Use subsections to make your writing clearer.
\subsection{Title of subsection 2}
Use subsections to make your writing clearer. 
\section{Anticipated Results}
Discuss what results you anticipate. 

Any number of subsections can be used or no subsections at all.
\subsection{Title of subsection 1}
Use subsections to make your writing clearer.
\subsection{Title of subsection 2}
Use subsections to make your writing clearer.
\section{Discussion}
Discuss the possible contribution of your research to the field. Connect the expected results to the research results in similar studies. Refer to the literature about the similar studies. Mention the possible limitations of the study and ways to overcome them.

Any number of subsections can be used or no subsections at all.
\subsection{Title of subsection 1}
Use subsections to make your writing clearer.
\subsection{Name of subsection 2}
Use subsections to make your writing clearer.
